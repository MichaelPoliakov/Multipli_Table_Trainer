# Multipli_Table_Trainer
Multiplication Table Trainer for SAT Preparation

This Python project is a multiplication table trainer designed to help users master multiplication up to 20x20, and important squares (up to 12²) and cubes (up to 4³), essential for SAT test preparation. The app prompts the user with multiplication challenges, providing timed feedback (2.5 seconds per question) and colored response indicators (right/wrong).

Key Features:

	•	20x20 Multiplication Trainer: Generate multiplication problems to practice all basic multiplication facts.
	•	Squares and Cubes Focus: Special emphasis on squares and cubes that are important for memorization.
	•	Adaptive Difficulty: The app focuses on harder, less-remembered multiplication problems (e.g., 7x8 or 12x11) and reduces the frequency of easier ones (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3).
	•	Performance Tracking: Tracks user performance, allowing the app to increase the frequency of questions in areas where improvement is needed.
	•	Fast Feedback: Provides immediate color-coded feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect, yellow for slow responses).

Future Features:

	•	Adaptive Learning: The app will learn from user responses, dynamically adjusting the difficulty level to focus more on problem areas.
	•	Custom Timers: Option to adjust the response time to match user preferences.

Perfect for anyone looking to sharpen their multiplication skills, especially for SAT test preparation!
